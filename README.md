# UsingAPIdataInReact
AUTHOR: Maija Philip
ISTE 340: Client Programming 
Project: iSchool Website Copycat
  Create a website with the data from our iSchool API in React using libraries
  to display the data in a nice way.

This is a react project so I only included the src file. In the src folder, there is a 
specific ReadMe on what libraries I used, in short I used Semantic and MUI.


My Thoughts:
This project was really fun. I have used react as seen in my WeatherApp project,
but it was really nice to learn the proper syntax and way of doing things. I enjoyed
figuring out how to modify the components from libraries and figuring out little bugs
I think I struggled most when I found weird things I didn't understand in react. I made
a lot of tiny mistakes that I took forever to figure out and sometimes just needed another
pair of eyes. Overall, they weren't very frustrating errors and the project was super 
enjoyable.
